## Directory `./A-AV1/`
- Contains behavioral cloning work to to make a car run autonomously on app `formula-trend-1.0.0-alpha.4`

## Directory `./A-AV2/`
- Contains behavioral cloning work to make a car run autonomously on app `formula-trend-1.0.0-alpha.5`
- Contains behavioral cloning work to make a car run autonomously on app `formula-trend-1.0.0-beta.3`

## Directory `./A-AV3/`
- Contains models and script to make a car run autonomously on the apps:
```
formula-trend-1.0.0-alpha.5
formula-trend-1.0.0-beta.3
```

## TO IMPROVE The MODEL
- Include more data of "recovery driving", IE during turns if it overshoots, it should have data how to
recover from the overshooting.
- Play with hypter parameters
